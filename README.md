# Holiday Cost Calculator

This is a Python program that helps you calculate the total cost of your holiday.

# What It Does
The program asks you:
- Which city you want to fly to (from a list of available cities)
- How many nights you’ll stay in a hotel
- How many days you’ll rent a car

Then it shows you the total cost of:
- Hotel stay
- Flight
- Car rental
- And the overall total cost of your trip

# How to Use It
1. Run the `holiday.py` file.
2. Choose a city from the list: Los Angeles, Shanghai, Delhi, or Tokyo.
3. Enter how many nights you’ll stay at a hotel.
4. Enter how many days you’ll rent a car.
5. The program will show a full cost breakdown.

## Example Output
